Successfully created a dynamic program to repair 6278 corrupted JSON files from a client company, transforming them into usable JSON files in less than 10 seconds using Python. Subsequently, I merged all these files into a single Excel table for easy reanalysis using Microsoft Power Query (PT Kaneka Foods Indonesia).
